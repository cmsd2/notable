/**
 * One page, open in one view: which page it is, and everything derived from the page record itself.
 *
 * ### Why this exists
 *
 * `PageDataManager` holds a single `pageFromDb`, and every notion of "the current page" is derived
 * from it:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * private val currentPage: String get() = pageFromDb?.id.orEmpty()
 * ```
 *
 * So a view that asked the manager *which page am I showing?* got an app-wide answer. With one
 * editor that is always right and therefore invisible; with two it means both views report the same
 * page, read the same strokes, and overwrite each other's `setPage`.
 *
 * This is the fourth time the same shape has appeared — the window buffer, the viewport, the signal
 * bus, and now page identity were all single-instance state living in a shared object. The fix is
 * the same each time: **the per-view object owns its live state, while the shared singleton keeps
 * cache and persistence keyed by id.**
 *
 * ### Division of labour
 *
 * Anything derived from the page *record* — background name and type, whether transforms are
 * allowed, the page number within its notebook — is answered here, from this view's own [entity].
 * Strokes, images, bitmaps and backgrounds stay in [PageDataManager], which already keys them all
 * by page id and pools backgrounds across pages.
 *
 * [PageDataManager.setPage] is still called for the *foreground* page, because the manager
 * legitimately needs to know which page to prefetch neighbours for and which to protect from
 * eviction. That is a statement about focus, not about identity.
