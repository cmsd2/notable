/**
 * The editor's view onto a page: how far it is scrolled, how far it is zoomed, and the conversion
 * between screen and page coordinates.
 *
 * Extracted from [com.ethran.notable.editor.PageView], which had accumulated this alongside page
 * lifecycle, data proxying and rendering. Pairs with
 * [com.ethran.notable.editor.drawing.PageRenderer]: the renderer owns *where* pixels land, this
 * owns *which part of the page* they represent.
 *
 * ### The viewport is per-view, not per-page
 *
 * [scroll], [zoomLevel] and the viewport dimensions are held here, so two views of the *same* page
 * scroll and zoom independently — which is the point of being able to open a document twice.
 *
 * [PageDataManager] remains the *persistence* layer: writes are mirrored into it so `setScrollInDb`
 * can reach the database, the scroll indicator can read the current position, and reopening a page
 * restores where you were. It is no longer the live source of truth.
