/**
 * Owns the editor's *window buffer*: the screen-sized bitmap a page is drawn into, the canvas
 * wrapping it, and the spare buffer reused when scrolling.
 *
 * This is deliberately about the **buffer**, not the **content**. Deciding what to draw needs the
 * page's strokes, images and background, and stays on
 * [com.ethran.notable.editor.PageView]; this class only manages the surface those things land on.
 * Keeping that line sharp is what lets the buffer be per-view later without dragging page data
 * along with it.
 *
 * Note the bitmap is *view-sized*, not page-sized — it is a window onto the page, which is why
 * scrolling shifts pixels and redraws only the newly exposed strip rather than re-rendering
 * everything.
 *
 * ### Resizing is a normal operation
 *
 * [resize] is idempotent and safe to call repeatedly. That matters because the editor is moving to
 * a draggable split divider, where re-layout is user-driven rather than a rare event. **Callers
 * decide when to call it**; this class deliberately holds no debounce policy, because a bitmap
 * reallocation per drag frame would thrash both the heap and the e-ink panel.
